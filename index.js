I am getting addicted to Fab Bag's. The first one I had ordered was simply to check it out as my friend had recommended. I am not someone who spends a lot of time thinking about beauty products and I am clueless when it comes to such matters. Which is why the Fab Bag's are perfect for me. This August Fab Bag had everything I needed! The product curation is perfect. It's like having my own personal shopper for beauty products and such pretty bags too.

Surprises brings excitement and I am always excited to receive my Fab Bag. First of all I should say that the Bags are awesome and each time I got my Fab Bag, I was really happy to find whats inside it. Really satisfied! :)

And top of it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Every month I just wait for my bag as a small kid waits for her favourite toy. This Fab Bag is an upright bliss.
